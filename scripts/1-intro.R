b <- 5              # assign 5 to b

a                   # so what's the value of OBJECT "a"

# What happens if we change a and then re-add a and b? [Hint: Try it now]
#
# Does it work if you just change a in the script and then add a and b? [Hint: Try it]
#
# Did you still get the same answer after you changed a? 
# If so, why do you think that might be?
#
# We can also assign the result of a + b to a new variable, c. 
# How would you do this?

# We’re going to work with some genome lengths (measured in megabases).
#
# 1. Create object genome_length_mb and assign it the value 4.6 (E.cloi)
#
# Solution:


# 2. Convert this length, to the weight of the genome in picograms.
#    Use the conversion: 978Mb = 1picogram.
#
# Solution:


# 3. If the human genome is approx 3,300 megabases - approx how heavy is it.
#
# Solution:


# 4. Store the calculated weight in an object called: genome_weight_pg
#
# Solution:


# 5. If we change genome_length_mb to another value (say 2,800 - eg a mouse)
#    does the value value of genome_weight_pg get dated ?
